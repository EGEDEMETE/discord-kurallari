1. Completely quit Discord using the task manager or the system tray.
2. Open Run (`Win + R`), type `%localappdata/%` and press OK.
3. Navigate to the `Discord` folder, and delete the folder inside named `app-1.0.9005`. If there is no such folder, or if it is named differently (e.g `app-1.0.9004`), delete it reguardless.
4. Restart your PC and relaunch Discord. It might throw an error at you, just ignore that and continue with the guide.
5. Download and install BetterDiscord. The installer can be found at [BetterDiscord's official site](https://betterdiscord.app/).
6. Restart Discord by quitting it from the task manager or the system tray, and launching it again.

    If none of the steps mentioned above work, as a last resort you could try reinstalling [Discord](https://discord.com/download) and [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) from scratch.
