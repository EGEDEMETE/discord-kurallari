# I can't upload to sxcu.net

If you see an error popup after uploading an image, saying something along the lines of
`System.Exception: Invalid function name: "color"` then your upload settings are invalid.
This is caused by a recent Sharex update which added custom `{functions}`, mixing up with the json syntax.
Follow the steps below to fix this issue:

1. Go to **Destinations > Custom uploader settings**
2. Select sxcu.net from the **Uploaders** list
3. Copy the value of `og_properties` into notepad
4. Place backslashes (\) before each curly bracket in the code (e.g. `\{"color":"#ff0000"\}`)
5. Copy the code from notepad back into ShareX
